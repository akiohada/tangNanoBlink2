@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/vagrant/workspace/verilogLeson/blink002/src/blink.v":58:2:58:7|Found inferred clock FourDigitLedController|clock which controls 48 sequential elements including chatteringCounter[15]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
