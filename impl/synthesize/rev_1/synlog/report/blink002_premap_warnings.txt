@W: MT529 :"/home/vagrant/workspace/verilogLeson/blink002/src/blink.v":42:2:42:7|Found inferred clock SHIFT_RESISTER|clock which controls 66 sequential elements including counter2[4:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
