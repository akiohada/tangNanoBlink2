@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: BN132 :"/home/vagrant/workspace/verilogLeson/blink002/src/blink.v":70:2:70:7|Removing sequential instance serialInDummy[1] because it is equivalent to instance serialDataIn. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"/home/vagrant/workspace/verilogLeson/blink002/src/blink.v":191:2:191:7|Found inferred clock SHIFT_RESISTER|clock which controls 83 sequential elements including digitCounter[1]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
